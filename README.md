# PowerBI_HR_Analytics_Dashboard-
I created this HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to visualize key metrics like employee attrition rate, average age, and salary trends. It offers insights into attrition by age, education, job role, and tenure, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions to improve retention.✏ 

Insights: This dashboard helps in identifying critical areas of concern in employee retention, such as specific age groups, job roles, and salary bands that are most susceptible to attrition. It provides actionable insights for HR teams to develop targeted strategies for reducing turnover. 💲 😍 ✏ 

Usage: This dashboard is an effective tool for HR managers and analysts to monitor and address employee attrition. It allows for data-driven decision-making to improve employee retention and optimize HR strategies.
